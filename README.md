# AutoDesktopOraganizerScript
This Python script automatically organizes files placed on your Desktop into categorized folders (e.g. Documents, Images, Videos, Audio, Archives, Others). It runs silently in the background, detects new files in real time, and moves them to their appropriate folders. Optional Windows notifications appear whenever files are moved.
